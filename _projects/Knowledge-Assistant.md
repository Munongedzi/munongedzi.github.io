## Problem

Important knowledge was scattered across emails, documents, notes, and reports, making retrieval slow and fragmented.

## Approach

Built a secure AI assistant that could:
- Ingest personal and organizational documents  
- Retrieve relevant context using vector search  
- Synthesize insights rather than just returning links  

## Tech Stack

- **AI:** RAG architecture  
- **Storage:** Vector database (Pinecone/Weaviate)  
- **NLP:** Embeddings + semantic retrieval  
- **Languages:** Python  
- **Interface:** Streamlit chat UI  

## What I Built

### Data Ingestion
- Processed PDFs, notes, emails, and reports  
- Embedded documents into vector space  
- Maintained secure access controls  

### AI Layer
- Retrieved relevant context per query  
- Generated concise, cited answers  
- Synthesized insights across sources  

### User Interface
- Conversational chat interface  
- Clear citation of sources  
- Privacy-first design  

## Results

- Faster knowledge retrieval  
- Reduced manual search time  
- Better synthesis across fragmented information  
- Secure handling of sensitive data  

## Lessons Learned

- RAG is only as good as data quality  
- Privacy controls must be built from day one  
- UX determines whether AI feels truly useful
