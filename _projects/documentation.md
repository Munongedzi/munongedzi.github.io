## Problem

Technical documentation was often outdated, inconsistent, or nonexistent, making onboarding and maintenance difficult in the research lab.

## Approach

Built an AI tool that:
- Analyzed code semantically, not just syntactically  
- Generated structured documentation automatically  
- Updated docs as code evolved  

## Tech Stack

- **NLP:** Code embeddings and semantic parsing  
- **Dev tooling:** GitHub integration  
- **Languages:** Python  
- **Automation:** CI/CD pipelines  

## What I Built

### Code Understanding Engine
- Parsed multi-file architectures  
- Identified key modules, dependencies, and patterns  
- Mapped relationships between components  

### Documentation System
- Auto-generated architecture diagrams  
- Created readable summaries for new engineers  
- Flagged undocumented areas of the codebase  

## Results

- Faster onboarding for new team members  
- More maintainable documentation  
- Less manual writing for engineers  
- Better long-term software sustainability  

## Lessons Learned

- Semantic understanding beats simple parsing  
- Docs must evolve with code, not be static  
- Automation works best when integrated into CI/CD
